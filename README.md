# Organising your data and software with a reproducible project workflow

## DCC Spring Training Days - day 2

In this Spring Training workshop, we will take you through the life cycle of a
project, teaching good habits along the way, and using familiar tools as much as
possible. We will start at the **PRESENT**, where you will create your project.
From a few data files (adapted from [Hope _et al._, 2021](data/README.md)), you
will create an organized project. Then, we will track the project's history in
**PAST**: you will make a changelog, and create a 'project release' with a
version number. Finally, in **FUTURE**, you will archive and license your
project so others can use it.

We will end the workshop with an informal sharing of our respective lessons from
the past.

### Preparation

See how you can prepare for this workshop [here](preparation.md).

### Code of Conduct

Participants are expected to follow these guidelines:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members
- We do not tolerate any form of discrimination, intimidation or harassment.

If you feel any one of these guidelines has been violated, please contact
training@esciencecenter.nl.

### Workflow

- Work in pairs (or groups of three); 'pair programming' style.
  - One of you is the _driver_: they share their screen and perform the actions.
  - The other(s) support(s) the driver, by e.g. looking up questions, and being
    active and engaged with the driver's work.
- Switch roles so that everyone in your team has been in the driver's seat:
  - The driver zips the entire project, and emails it to a partner *before the
    break*.
  - The recipient unzips all and confirms the project is complete.
  - Do not worry if you have not been able to finish the exercises. You can take
    your project to the next step.
- Ask for help when needed, we are happy to support you!
  - Use the "Ask for help" button in your breakout room. (Note that raised hands
    and chat messages will not be seen outside the room!)
  - A helper will join your breakout room.
