# Prepare for the workshop

Before you join the workshop, make sure you prepare the following:

- Make an account with [GitHub](https://github.com/join);
- Download the data files [here](https://github.com/escience-academy/2021-06-03-DCC-project-management/raw/main/data/datafiles.zip);
- Ensure you can zip and unzip files on your system (check it out with the zipped data files!)
- Ensure you can share your screen with Zoom (some systems require prior permission).

And finally, please be there for the whole workshop! You will be sorted into pairs, so your early departure or late arrival will not just interfere with your own enjoyment of the workshop, but also affect someone else's.
